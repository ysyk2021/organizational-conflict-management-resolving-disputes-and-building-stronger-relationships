Negotiation

Negotiation is a process of discussion and compromise between parties with conflicting interests or needs. The goal of negotiation is to find a mutually acceptable solution that meets the needs of all parties involved. Effective negotiation requires active listening, clear communication, and an understanding of the interests and needs of all parties involved.

### Steps in the Negotiation Process

The negotiation process typically involves the following steps:

1. Preparation: Each party prepares for the negotiation, identifying their goals, interests, and potential areas of compromise.
2. Opening: The parties meet and establish ground rules for the negotiation.
3. Exploration: The parties discuss their respective positions, interests, and needs, seeking opportunities for compromise.
4. Bargaining: The parties make offers and counteroffers, seeking to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.

Effective negotiation requires a willingness to compromise and a focus on finding common ground.

Mediation

The mediator acts as a neutral third party, helping the parties to identify their interests and needs, communicate effectively, and explore potential solutions. The goal of mediation is to help the parties reach a mutually acceptable agreement that addresses their needs and interests.

### Steps in the Mediation Process
