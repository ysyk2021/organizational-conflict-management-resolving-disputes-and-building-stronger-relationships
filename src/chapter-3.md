Organizational conflict can negatively impact workplace culture and organizational success in several ways, including:

* Contributing to absenteeism and turnover

By understanding these impacts, organizations can effectively manage conflicts and build stronger relationships among employees.

The Costs of Ignoring Organizational Conflict

Ignoring organizational conflict can have significant costs for organizations, including risks to employee morale, productivity, and reputation. By not addressing conflicts in a timely and effective manner, organizations risk reducing productivity and hindering progress on important business objectives. Additionally, if conflicts are not addressed effectively, they can lead to negative publicity, damage to the organization's reputation, and loss of customer trust and loyalty.
